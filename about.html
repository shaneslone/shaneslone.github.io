          <h1>About Me</h1>
          <p>
            From the first time I ever used a computer I knew I was hooked. It
            was an old Apple II computer that was in the classroom at my
            elementary school. I was amazed by the variety of different
            software, and right away I wonder how it was all made. From that
            early age I was set on the path to become a software engineer.
          </p>
          <p>
            I took every opportunity I could throughout elementary school and
            high school to work with computers and learn more about programming.
            I began writing my first web pages in the late 90s when I was still
            just a kid. They were just basic html pages that I cobbled together
            from what HTML I could teach myself, but I was always proud of what
            I had created. I remember taking my first “real” programming class
            in high school. It was on the basics of C++, and I wrote my first
            “Hello World” program. I knew I was hooked.
          </p>
          <p>
            After graduation high school I received a full tuition scholarship
            to attend Eastern Kentucky University where I majored in Computer
            Science. I loved my time at EKU, and enjoyed the struggle of
            learning difficult programming concepts. Unfortunately due to some
            personal tragedies in my life, my time at EKU would be cut short.
            One of my best friends, who was also attending EKU along with me
            died tragically. This led me to making what I consider to be the
            biggest mistake of my life, leaving school early before I had
            finished my degree. The plan was to always return to school once I
            had time to recover emotionally from the loss, but life doesn’t
            always work out the way you plan.
          </p>
          <p>
            Even though I didn’t finish my Computer Science degree, I never lost
            my passion for coding. Finally in early 2020, in what I didn’t
            realise at the time would be just the beginning of the global
            coronavirus pandemic, I made the decision to stop finding reasons
            not to achieve my dream. I made plans to quit my call center job and
            signed up for Lambda School, a 6 month immersive coding bootcamp.
            Though Lambda School wasn’t easy, the rate at which you are learning
            new concepts is daunting, I loved every second of it. Having now
            finished Lambda School I can confidently say I am ready to finally
            achieve the dream that began when that young boy loaded his first
            program from a floppy disk onto that Apple II.
